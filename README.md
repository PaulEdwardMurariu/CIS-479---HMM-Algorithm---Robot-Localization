# ðŸ¤– HMM Algorithm â€“ Robot Localization

This project implements a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**â€“based robot localization algorithm in Python.  
It was developed as part of the **CIS 479 course** (Artificial Intelligence) at the University of Michiganâ€“Dearborn.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate how a robot can **determine its position in a grid environment** using imperfect motion and sensor data.  
The algorithm estimates location probabilities through **recursive Bayesian filtering**, combining prediction and correction (filtering) steps.

## ðŸ§© Core Concepts
### Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
The algorithm models the environment as a **7 Ã— 7 grid** of states.  
Each state represents a potential robot position (open cell = 0, obstacle = 1).  
The model uses two primary probabilities:
- **Transition probability** â€” likelihood of moving from one cell to another
- **Sensor probability** â€” likelihood of observing a specific environment feature from that cell  

The localization loop alternates between:
1. **Prediction (motion update)** â€” accounts for drift and uncertainty when moving
2. **Filtering (sensor update)** â€” corrects probabilities using sensory input

## ðŸ§® Implementation Details
### Maze Definition
A 7Ã—7 maze defines obstacles (`1`) and open spaces (`0`):
```python
maze = [
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,1,0,1,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,1,0],
 [0,0,0,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,1,0,1,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
]
```
